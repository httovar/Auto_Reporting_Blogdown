# Automated Reporting with `Blogdown`

This is the more applied and technical documentation of the portfolio I created for the Advanced Data Analysis with R Class. Check out the [website](https://kind-wescoff-aaca29.netlify.app/about/) for a  short introduction to the portfolio. The basic idea of the project is to create an online reporting infrastructure that automatically goes through the steps of gathering the data, generating a (standardized) report, and publish the report online. Additionally, I found it desirable to find a solution that automatically initiates each iteration of the reporting cycle without having to source the R Script manually. As the class is focused on `R`, the entire project is meant to be controlled from within the `R` ecosystem. This ReadMe document goes over the core ideas of the project and also introduces the basic `R` commands and steps to reproduce a similar project. 

## Creating Websites with `blogdown`

The central infrastructure for this project is provided by the [`blogdown` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). The package provides an interface between `R`/`RStudio` and the static website generator `hugo`. Static websites as opposed to dynamic websites, consist of a collection of files (markdown, HTML, CSS, etc.) that are then processed to create a website. The website is static in the sense that it looks the same for every user and does not allow interaction that goes beyond accessing different parts of the website. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, require server-side scripts (like PHP) that allow for a dynamic interaction between the user and the website. For a reporting tool, however, a static website is sufficient, as there is no need for dynamic interaction.

In practice, the `blogdown` package requires a special folder structure that will convey where a certain file will be featured on the website. However, the package comes with the infrastructure to create this folder structure in the workflow of setting up a new blog. The basic workflow follows the following steps:

- Create a new Project within `RStudio` (THis is optional but makes things much easier)
- Pick a `hugo` theme for your website from https://themes.gohugo.io/
